1. Data Source Selection
    |
2. Data Retrieval from Sources (APIs, Downloads, etc.)
    |
3. Data Preprocessing
    |--- Genomic Datasets
    |       |--- Parse FASTA and BED files
    |       |--- Extract gene sequences and annotations
    |       |--- Quality control (sequence validity, annotation consistency)
    |
    |--- Medical Datasets
    |       |--- Extract relevant patient and clinical data
    |       |--- Normalize and anonymize data
    |       |--- Handle missing data and outliers
    |
    |--- Molecular Information
            |--- Extract molecular structures
            |--- Convert SMILES/InChI to suitable representations
            |--- Handle missing or incomplete molecular data
    |
4. Data Integration and Fusion
    |--- Match and merge data across sources (e.g., gene IDs)
    |--- Link molecular information with genetic and clinical data
    |
5. Feature Engineering
    |--- Generate derived features (e.g., sequence motifs, structural properties)
    |--- Embed categorical data (e.g., gene types, medical diagnoses)
    |--- Normalize continuous data (e.g., gene expression levels, clinical measurements)
    |
6. Data Splitting
    |--- Divide data into training, validation, and testing sets
    |--- Ensure balanced distribution of classes and conditions
    |
7. Data Format Conversion
    |--- Convert data into appropriate formats for model input
    |--- Represent sequences as numerical tensors
    |--- Transform molecular structures into graph or matrix representations
    |
8. Model Training and Validation
    |--- Train the hybrid neural network model
    |--- Validate model using cross-validation and evaluation metrics
    |
9. Iterative Optimization
    |--- Analyze model performance and errors
    |--- Adjust preprocessing steps and model architecture
    |--- Fine-tune hyperparameters based on validation results
    |
10. Model Deployment
    |--- Deploy the trained model in a suitable environment
    |--- Integrate with user interface or application
    |
11. Real-world Application
    |--- Provide input data (genomic, medical, molecular)
    |--- Model generates RNA-based therapeutic sequences
    |--- Validate therapeutic candidates using experimental data
    |
12. Feedback Loop
    |--- Collect user feedback on generated therapeutics
    |--- Incorporate user feedback into model improvement
    |--- Update and retrain the model periodically
