2. Data Retrieval from Sources (APIs, Downloads, etc.)
    |
3. Data Preprocessing
    |--- Genomic Datasets (e.g., GenBank, Ensembl)
    |       |--- Parse FASTA and BED files
    |       |--- Extract gene sequences and annotations
    |
    |--- Medical Datasets (e.g., EHR, disease databases)
    |       |--- Extract relevant patient and clinical data
    |       |--- Normalize and anonymize data
    |
    |--- Molecular Information (e.g., PubChem)
            |--- Extract molecular structures
            |--- Convert SMILES/InChI to suitable representations
    |
4. Data Integration and Fusion
